# Car Auto controller 

## Overview

This is the code for a two phase project for SWEN30006. The objective was to create a controller that navigates a car from start to finish. Along the way, the car would have to avoid obstacles (including walls, and lava), maintain its health, and complete objectives (pick up numbered keys in order).
